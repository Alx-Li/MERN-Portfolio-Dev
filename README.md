Welcome to the repo for my portfolio website. Check the change logs below for anything that I have added or changed with each major/minor update. Please keep in mind that this is my first project with JS, and material-ui and jsx styling is kinda annoying. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesnt ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. It takes 3 hrs of banging my head against the keyboard to make it display as per my designs. I would gladly take suggestions and code fixes for this mess, but I would like to ask that a detailed description is provided.

## Notes:

Styling is so bad you think something would work but it doesnt apply when you save the files, there are so many little nuances that makes me bash my head into my desk.

why are there so many frameworks üò©


## Changelog

### v0.1.1-b 
- Footer completely implemented, responsive to mobile devices and small windows
- Set up environmental variables 

```
PORT = ###
CONNECTION_URL = ****
```

### v0.1.0-b
First commit after doing some work on the front end and figuring out how to set up and communicate between the front and back end. Huge thanks to the tutorials from [JavaScript Mastery](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmXmlB4-HJytD7wek0Uo97A) as it would have been much more difficult to figure out everything from just reading documentation.

Major additions:
- Header bar added and fully implemented
  - (additional links and darkmode function to be implemented later)
- Footer Added
  - wip, but dynamic scaling has been implemented
- Set up file structure 
- Logos animated
  - Credits to the [SVGO](https://github.com/svg/svgo) and [Vivus](https://github.com/maxwellito/vivus) libraries/tools for cleaning my svg and animating.
