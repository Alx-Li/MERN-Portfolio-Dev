### v0.1.0-b
First commit after doing some work on the front end and figuring out how to set up and communicate between the front and back end. Huge thanks to the tutorials from [JavaScript Mastery](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmXmlB4-HJytD7wek0Uo97A) as it would have been much more difficult to figure out everything from just reading documentation.

Major additions:
- Header bar added and fully implemented
  - (additional links and darkmode function to be implemented later)
- Footer Added
  - wip, but dynamic scaling has been implemented
- Set up file structure 
- Logos animated
  - Credits to the [SVGO](https://github.com/svg/svgo) and [Vivus](https://github.com/maxwellito/vivus) libraries/tools for cleaning my svg and animating.

Notes:

Styling is so bad you think something would work but it doesnt apply when you save the files, there are so many little nuances that makes me bash my head into my desk.

why are there so many frameworks ðŸ¥²
